1:  State the problem clearly. Identify the inputs and the outputs
Given a rotated list that was previously sorted, we need to find the MINIMUM number of times it was rotated
The input would be an array of numbers e.g. num: [7,9,3,5,6]
Output would be the number of times the sorted list was rotated e.g. 2


2: Create the function

3: Make different cases

4: Create Test Case Checker

5: Brute Force Algorithm

-If we look closely, we can see that if a list of sorted numbers is rotated n times,
then the smallest number in the list ends up at position k (counting from 0).
Furthermore, it is the only number in the list that is smaller than the numbers before it

-Therefore,  
	-we need to check for each number in the list whether it is smaller than the number that comes before it
	-then the number of rotations (answer) is the index of the number
	-if no number greater than the smallest number is in front of it, it wasn't rotated

E.g. [19,25,29,3,5,6,7,9,11,14]
-number 3 is the smallest number which is at index 3

Can use linear search as the first attempt to solve it

6: Describe
	a. Create a variable POSITION with value 0
	b. Compare the element of the current POSITION with the number before it
	c. If the number is smaller than its, predecessor, then return the position
	d. Otherwise, increment position and repeat until use up all the numbers

7. Binary Search Algorithm
Given two instances, where the middle of the element is not the answer.

Try to look for a pattern
[7, 8, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]			-answer left to the middle element
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1, 0]			-answer right to the middle element

Understanding The Problem: Rotation means that the greater number is moved to the right, making the smaller
number remaining on the left side of the array

-simply checking the size with the middle element and the predecessor/successor doesn't work
	-because if rotated a lot, the smaller numbers can be at the end

SOLUTION: 
	-if the middle element of the array has a number smaller than that of the last element
		-The smallest number is on the left
	-else
		-Number on the right


What are the variables that are needed?
	-The start, end, and middle of the array
	-nums array


8. Try Changing to a Generic form 
	-all we need to do is (1) write a separate BinarySearch method and (2)change the return value to an easy-to-read to read string 
	-Note that we move the midNumber assignment and calculation to the BinarySearch method 

9. More Edge cases
	-Finding repeating numbers - this one is similar to the regular Binary Search Algorithm	
	-So what do we know about the problem	
		1. The array is sorted before it is rotated; therefore, it's in an ascending order (thus, the smallest number on the left)
		2. We have to find the smallest number's index to find the number of rotations
		3. To do a binary search, we have 3 variables: head, tail, mid
			-we initialize the variables: head = 0; tail = len(array); mid = (head + tail )//2
			-Assuming it is a sorted list
				###Since it is rotated, we cant move head and tail freely
				-Repeat loop until the head reaches the tail: while(head <= tail)
				-COUNTING ROTATIONS
					-only 3 possibilities
					-In the mid; if the preceding number is greater then midNumber is automatically the least number	
					-Left Half; midNumber < array[tail]
					-Right Half: midNumber > array[tail]
		4. If we find the smallest number, we have to check if it is repeated
			-The only positions we have to check is the left side, because the leftmost one is the original first index
			-Check if the preceding number is greater than the number
				-if yes, return index
				-else (preceding number < midNumber) move the tail to the left
